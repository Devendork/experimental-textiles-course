# Guest Lecture Bios and Information
This course will overlap with the [Experimental Weaving Talk Series](https://unstable.design/experimental-weaving-talks/), which is run in conjuction with the [Experimental Weaving Resdiency](https://unstable.design/experimental-weaving-residency/) in the Unstable Design Lab. This talk series will look to both shape what "experimental" weaving means and identify areas of resonance between weaving, design and engineering. The guest speakers all have practices that push the boundaries of woven structure and mechanics. By sharing their practices, students will gain first hand access to this unique area of expertise and be able to apply the techqiues presented in to their research and creative work. You can read more about the series and the individual speakers here: [Experimental Weaving Talk Series](https://unstable.design/experimental-weaving-talks/)

<!-- 
### 09.14 - Melanie Olde ##
Melanie's Bio:  Melanie Olde’s professional weaving experience has been in business, research, teaching and exhibiting nationally and international.  She researches cellular structures for form, function and array in order to interpret these in biomimetic, complex woven cloth in 3-dimensions to advance innovative exploration and design.  Olde works on an AVL 24 shaft CompuDobby Loom in Canberra, Australia and has also worked with mechanical and computerized jacquard systems at Fondazione Arte della Seta Lisio in Florence, Italy.

### 09.28 - Kathryn Walters ###
Bio: Kathryn Walters is currently working on a PhD in Smart Textile Design at the Swedish School of Textiles investigating how we can create smart textiles without electronics, exploring how complex textile behaviors can be designed to be responsive. [website](https://www.kmwalters.com/)


### 10.19 - Jessy Lu ###
Bio:  Jessy Lu examines the relationship between textiles, computation, and femininity. While graphical user interfaces obscure our understanding of an underlying technology and mathematical models run our economy, Lu’s textiles work is an act of primitive code. With strictly binary inputs, the textile functions purely as a computational byproduct, which endows the user with agency through its creation.

### 10.26 - Alyson Ainsworth ###
Bio: Alyson Ainsworth is a New York City-based weaver whose work challenges the traditional limitations of the loom. She is interested in pushing the boundaries of weaving as a discipline—from both art and design perspectives—and exploring the intersection of functional and aesthetic textiles in the process.
