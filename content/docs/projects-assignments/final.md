# Final Project: Keep Following the Materials

Your final project is to extend what you learned in your midterm by making a swatch for a class swatch book that demonstrates what you discovered in your experimentation. We take inspiration in this assignment from the [e-textiles swatch exchange](http://etextile-summercamp.org/2013/?cat=12), where practitioners develop small samples of a material outcome of a technique they developed and instructions for replication that are shared into a physical book with other practitioners. This is a chance for you to explore one technique or material more deeply, and to present it to the class.

**The Assignment Description:**   
Taking into consideration all of the ways you have learned to create a textile/substrate, create a swatch for the course swatch book \(yes! we will be making physical books\). Each student **should make 2 copies of the same swatch.** One for themselves, one for the book

Your swatch should emerge from a challenge that you defined in the midterm. The aim can change, but try to stick somewhat the the original question and hueristic. For your swatch book page, you must title your swatch and write a description of its behavior. You must include a list of the materials and tools used to create it as well as the draft or AdaCAD workflow you used to create it. Depending on the function of your swatch, you can either include a technical circuit diagram or instructions for replicating your swatch. The draft should label all the parts of the swatch, how they function, and how it can be connected to. You must also cite at minimum two sources/references.** 

Maximum swatch dimensions: 5.5" x 7.75" x 0.25"  
Quantity: 3 copies of the same swatch  
  
**You will keep one copy and give the other two to the instructor for grading**. We will also compile them into course books that will live on in our institutional library \(and possibility digital archives\).  


Please review the deadlines and phases of the project in the table below for details on each phase:

| **Item** | Percent of Final Grade | Date Due |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Deliverable 1: Process Documentation and Samples | 40% | 12/7 |
| Deliverable 2: Physical Swatches | 40% | 12/7 |
| Deliverable 4: Presentation | 20% | 12/5 |


### Deliverable 1: Process Documentation and Samples - Due 12/7

This deliverable is almost identical to the midterm in that you will turn in via canvas a weekly-style reflection on the part of your project completed between the midterm and findings. Use the weekly template to describe the process of your final. Your documentation should include photos of at least three swatches that you created as you worked on the final (created after the midterm) as well as the drafts for those swatches.  Identify at least three key decision points in your process where you changed plans, tried something new, or developed a new approach to optimize your swatch towards your heuristic. Describe these in writing. This is the primary place in the assignment where I will grade you on your decisions so provide strong reasoning for why you tried different techniques at different times.Include a reflection at the end of the documentation about what you would still like to try or what you think you should have done differently. Turn this in as a URL via canvas.

Bring all the samples (which aren't your final two swatches) you have produced as part of your final to class in a single plastic (preferably zip lock) bag with your name on it on the last day of class (12/7).


### Deliverable 2: Swatches & Swatch Book Page - Due 12/7 

Turn in 2 structurally identical swatches of your best or favorite sample for inclusion in the course swatch book.

Maximum swatch dimensions: 5.5" x 7.75" x 0.25".

Turn in in person, in class on 12/7 or before.
Also Submit a PDF of a page with details about your swatch and its design for the course swatch book. Use the template provided in Canvas.

You must include a list of the materials and tools used to create your swatch with enough detail that a different student in the class could implement what you did. Include details about the loom you used, the materials on the warp and the warp density. Depending on the function of your swatch, you can either include a technical circuit diagram or instructions for replicating your swatch. You must also include an illustrated diagram. The illustrated diagram should label all the parts of the swatch, how they function, and how it can be connected to. You must also cite at minimum two sources/references.


### Deliverable 3: Presentation - Due 10/31 

A max 3 minute presentation about your process and outcomes since the midterm. We will present our projects on 12/5 and 12/7. You may not be done with the project when it comes time to present so just present the farthest you have gone with your project to that point. Please submit this presentation via Canvas as a Google Slides Presentation so professor Devendorf can load them all, and present them all. Turn in a link to your presentation on Canvas by 9am on 12/5
