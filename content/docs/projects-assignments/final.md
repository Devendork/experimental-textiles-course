# Final Project: Keep Following the Materials

Your final project is to extend what you learned in your midterm by making a swatch for a class swatch book that demonstrates some functionality, possibly something that you discovered. We take inspiration in this assignment from the [e-textiles swatch exchange](http://etextile-summercamp.org/2013/?cat=12), where practitioners develop small samples of a material outcome of a technique they developed and instructions for replication that are shared into a physical book with other practitioners. This is a chance for you to explore one technique or material more deeply, and to present it to the class.

**The Assignment Description:**   
Taking into consideration all of the ways you have learned to create a textile/substrate, create a swatch for the course swatch book \(yes! we will be making physical books\). Each student **should make 3 copies of the same swatch.** 

Your swatch should emerge from a challenge that you define. Perhaps that challenge is figuring out how to best integrate a given material, a new approach to drafting, or the desire to achieve a specific function. Maybe it will function as some kind of sensor \(stretch, bend, force, etc\), have the ability to actuate \(change shape, color, stiffness in response to a stimulus\) or have a unique and intentional property \(biodegradable, super softness, texture change on interaction, etc\). For your swatch book page, you must title your swatch and write a description of its behavior. You must include a list of the materials and tools used to create it as well as the draft / AdaCAD file used to create it. Depending on the function of your swatch, you can either include a technical circuit diagram or instructions for replicating your swatch. The draft should label all the parts of the swatch, how they function, and how it can be connected to. You must also cite at minimum two sources/references.** 

For your swatch book page, you must use the template provided in canvas  \(in addition to any of your own documentation you might like to keep\) title your swatch and write a description of its function. You must include a list of the materials and tools used to create your swatch. Depending on the function of your swatch, you can either include a technical circuit diagram or instructions for replicating your swatch. You must also include an illustrated diagram. The illustrated diagram should label all the parts of the swatch, how they function, and how it can be connected to. You must also cite at minimum two sources/references. 

Maximum swatch dimensions: 5.5" x 7.75" x 0.25"  
Quantity: 3 copies of the same swatch  
  
**You will keep one copy and give the other two to the instructor for grading**. We will also compile them into course books that will live on in our institutional library \(and possibility digital archives\).

| **Item** | Percent of Final Grade | Date Due |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Deliverable 1: [Concept](midterm.md#deliverable-1-concept---due-wednesday-1012) | 10% | ?? |
| Deliverable 2: [Physical Swatches](midterm.md#d2) | 40% | 10/31 |

### Deliverable 1: Concept - Due Wednesday 10/12 

Bring a concept that you'd like to explore, some materials you might need to achieve it, to class October 12. You will use this class to present your concept to your peers for feedback. Come to class prepared with a description of the swatch you are planning to develop as well as a sense of what you are going to test, why and how you are going to do those tests. 


### Deliverable 2: Physical Swatches - Due 10/31 

Make 3 physical copies of your swatch and bring them to class on 10/31.

### Deliverable 3: Documentation - Due 10/31 

Turn in your documentation page as a PDF via Canvas \(the instructors will print it and attach your swatch to it. You must use the template provided on Canvas, but are also welcome to submit any additional materials you added to a personal blog or project page. 

### Deliverable 4: Presentation - Due 10/31 

You will present your swatch to the class on 10/31. Each student will have ~5 minutes for presentation and feedback. Prepare a short \(about 3 minute\) presentation that explains what you have made and how you developed the concept. 

Please submit this presentation via Canvas as a Google Slides Presentation so professor Devendorf can load them all, and present them all,  Please also prepare one question for the class so we can provide you feedback on your idea. 

Turn in a link to your presentation on Canvas by 9am on 10/31
