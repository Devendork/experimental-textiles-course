# 9. Designing for Jacquard
This is a multi-week weekly with several checkpoints along the way. The overall goal of the weekly is to get familiar with designing for Jacquard and to make a few samples using this technique. 

## Step 1: Designing for Jacquard, Due Wednesday 9th
On Monday November 7 In Class, we will develop design files for a Jacquard loom using AdaCAD. Each student will produce a file that is 2617 pixels/ends wide and now more than 50 pixels/pics tall and export the file as a bitmap. While you make this file, consider that the density of the loom is 60 ends per inch. You can choose to use any materials from a pre-selected list provided by the professor. We will work together to generate and get feedback on these files in class. You will use that feedback, and updated your design, and a "final" file that you would like to prodice via Canvas before Wednesday the 9th. 

We'll review the "final" files on Wednesday in class to make sure they can be woven effectively. Laura will then weave them over the weekend and bring them to class Monday November 14. 


## Step 2: Designing for Jacquard, Due Wednesday 15th
Based on your result, you will update your file, again, and submit it before class on Wednesday the 15th. Each student will then have a chance to weave their (or someone elses') file on the loom itself during class on Wednesday.
