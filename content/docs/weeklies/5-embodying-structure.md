# 5. Embodying Weave Structure

This weekly is a 2-week weekly that will consist of several parts. Complete the following: 

1. Complete the [reverse drafting worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j2uLIZfA-a7bwwISSsO788CdLPI-bh-V-y6ogFHDkHA/edit#gid=0) with a swatch that will be provided to you in class. Follow each step on the worksheet carefully and make notes and comments about what you learned through this process in your weekly write up. Please bring your physical worksheet to class on Oct 10 for grading as part of this weekly. 

2. Find a different woven sample and try to come up with an explanation of how it was drafted. What structures were used in what combinations. Use terminology from weaving in your explaination such as (interlacement, float, tabby, twill, satin)

3. Spend 2 hours weaving on the 8-shaft loom (an appointment calendar is available via Canvas). Listen to your favorite album, weave something that reminds you of the music. Focus on the feel, giving yourself room to play. Leave your work on the loom and weave a 2" tabby header after your work to prep the loom for the next person. Include images of what you made and how you went about doing it 


Bonus: As you weave on the 8 shaft, somehow integrate two separate conductive yarns such that when you move the swatch (fold, stretch, twist), the two threads connect and conduct electricity.  Include images of what you made and how you went about doing it
