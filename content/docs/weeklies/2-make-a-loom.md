Repeat the process to make a loom with the following specifications. Your loom should have at least 20 ends/warps and use at least 2 colors. Weave two colors in any combination in the weft. Integrate at least 12" of conductive yarn or thread into the weave by any means you imagine. Weave something that relates to the contents of the book. Ask yourself, what else could you make a loom out of? 

Bring your book loom and weave to class. 


<!-- Work with your partner to warp 3 yards onto your class loom. Warp the loom with 60 ends at 10 epi.   using 2 colors (perhaps one per partner?) in the warp and 2 colors in the weft. Weave 12 inches of cloth and integrate at least 24 inches of conductive yarn. Cut the yarn off the loom, and measure the resistance as you move the yarn. What sensor did you make?
