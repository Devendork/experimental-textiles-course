# 5. Layer and Press

Use [AdaCAD](http://adacad.org) to design a multi-layer weave where the layers change order at one or more places in the structure. Weave and then create it on your loom and see if you can use it to create a press button by integrating a conductive yarn in the top and bottom layers.
