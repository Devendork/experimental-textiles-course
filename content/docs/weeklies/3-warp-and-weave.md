{{< youtube hIXM0ZwJUQQ >}}

Work with your partner to warp your cricket loom with  1 - 2 yards of cloth, 4-5 inches wide at 8 ends per inch. 

While you are working on a shared loom, each student should weave 3, 3-4‚Äù sections that experiment with a different technique and weave 2 inches of a tabby between each section. In each section, integrate 12" of conductive thread into the weave using a different technique you make up. You are also welcome to play with the weave strucure in each section if you like. Bring the swatches to class on the loom. 

During class, we'll cut them off the loom and study them. Extra credit to groups that weave ALL their warp.
