# 3. Warp and Weave
Work with your partner to warp your loom with at least 10 yards of cloth, 4-5 inches wide. Create five shafts/harnesses and thread them using a straight draw. weave 1 3-4” section of any twill you choose, and another of any satin that you choose. Integrate 24” of conductive into each swatch and bring the swatches to class.
