# 4. Dynamic Wefts

This week we will be rewarping and adding "frames" to our looms. Wind 2 yards of warp using a warping board or improvised method and then attach it to your loom. You should wind 40-50 warps using the 3/2 pearl cotton yarn provided in class.  Use string heddles to create four frames in a straight draw. 

Next, collect some materials to weave with that you wouldn't typically consider to be "yarn". This can include plant fibers you find on a walk, tubing or ropes you seem to have on hand, or anything else you might imagine. 

Experiment with methods to integrate your material into the woven structure. What works? Do you weave some pics with cotton and add your material to others? Do you bunch up your material and insert it as a single weft? Play with different functional and aesthetic possibilities and when you found a structure you like, weave 3" of it with tabby on either side. Document the structure you created in AdaCAD.org and include it in your weekly.

Cut your swatches off your loom and bring them to class Monday.

# 4. Dynamic Wefts

This week, try to weave something other than "yarn". Ideas include tubing, monofilament, shape memory alloys, paper, elatic or others you might think of.

Use [AdaCAD](http://adacad.org) to design a compound structure to use when you work with this material. 

Work with your partner to warp your loom with  1 - 2 yards of cloth, 4-5 inches wide at any density you wish (though 10 epi is probably best with the yarns we'll give you). Create at least 4 shafts/harnesses (though this will largely depend on your structure...so coordinate with your partner)  -->
