# Experimental Textiles

A textile describes any material made from fiber (which is any material with a high length with width ratio). While textiles are ubiquitous in our daily interactions, forming the basis of clothing and apholstery as well as communications cables, argricultrual scafolds and composites, interaction designs and engineers have not yet explored their possibilities deeply for interactive applications. 

This course is intended to shed light on how textiles can be uesd to create functional systems and engineered to produce highly specific purposes. The goal is to encourage students outside of textiles to consider how they might integrate textile structures into their research and prototyping practice, or, for textiles experienced students to learn how their knowledges can be useful for producing new kinds of sensors, actuators, and otherwise "dynamic" textile systems. 

This semester will focus deeply on weaving with a deep look at the possibilities of woven structure as well as the ways in which structures can be designed and fabricated using many materials. This is a very central focus of Prof. Devendorf's Unstable Design Lab  and we will invite students to investigate it alongside of us.

## After Taking This Course
Students will be able to: 
- Warp and Weave on both Harness and Jacquard Looms
- Design Custom Woven Structures To Suit Applications
- Have a Broad Knowledge of Textile Techniques and Their uses Through History
- Have a Broad Knowledge of Textile Materials and their Particular Functional Properties. 
- Gain insight into the state of the art in textile structure design from leading experts.
