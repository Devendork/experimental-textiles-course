We take inspiration in this assignment from the e-textiles swatch exchange, where practitioners develop small samples of a material outcome of a technique they developed and instructions for replication that are shared into a physical book with other practitioners. This is a chance for you to explore one technique or material more deeply, and to present it to the class.\nThe Assignment Description:\nTaking into consideration all of the ways you have learned to create a textile/substrate, create a swatch for the course swatch book (yes! we will be making physical books). Each student should make 3 copies of the same swatch.\nYour swatch should emerge from a challenge that you define. Perhaps that challenge is figuring out how to best integrate a given material, a new approach to drafting, or the desire to achieve a specific function. Maybe it will function as some kind of sensor (stretch, bend, force, etc), have the ability to actuate (change shape, color, stiffness in response to a stimulus) or have a unique and intentional property (biodegradable, super softness, texture change on interaction, etc). For your swatch book page, you must title your swatch and write a description of its behavior. You must include a list of the materials and tools used to create it as well as the draft / AdaCAD file used to create it. Depending on the function of your swatch, you can either include a technical circuit diagram or instructions for replicating your swatch. The draft should label all the parts of the swatch, how they function, and how it can be connected to. You must also cite at minimum two sources/references.**\nFor your swatch book page, you must use the template provided in canvas (in addition to any of your own documentation you might like to keep) title your swatch and write a description of its function. You must include a list of the materials and tools used to create your swatch. Depending on the function of your swatch, you can either include a technical circuit diagram or instructions for replicating your swatch. You must also include an illustrated diagram. The illustrated diagram should label all the parts of the swatch, how they function, and how it can be connected to. You must also cite at minimum two sources/references.\nMaximum swatch dimensions: 5.5\u0026quot; x 7.75\u0026quot; x 0.25\u0026quot;\nQuantity: 3 copies of the same swatch\nYou will keep one copy and send the other two to the instructors for grading (details below). We will also compile them into course books that will live on in our institutional library (and possibility digital archives).\nPlease review the deadlines and phases of the project in the table below for details on each phase:\nBelow, you will\nItem Percent of Midterm Grade Date Due Deliverable 1a: Concept 5% 10/3 Deliverable 1b: Concept Update 5% 10/14 Deliverable 2: Physical Swatches 40% 10/31 Deliverable 3: Documentation 40% 10/31 Deliverable 4: Presentation 10% 10/31 Deliverable 1: Concept - Due Wednesday 10/12 # Bring a concept that you\u0026rsquo;d like to explore, some materials you might need to achieve it, to class October 12.

We expect all students to be actively engaged in discussions and/or show and tells.\nAttendance # All students will have 2 absences excused automatically. Any additional absences and make up points will need to be coordinated with the instructor. ****Due to COVID, we are willing to make additional exceptions in conversation with students. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need an alternative schedule.\nResearch Activities # This course has been developed as part of a larger grant studying smart textiles collaboration. In week two, the instructor or one of her students will describe how research will take place in the class and give you the opportunity to opt into or out of those research activities. Your participation in the research activities will have no effects on your grade.\nContacting Prof. Devendorf # I prefer that students utilize my office hours with questions or comments about the class. Please send all email inquiries to laura.devendorf@colorado.edu. Please also put “[SO]” in the subject line so that I can easily recognize and respond to your email. I will do my best to respond to emails within one “business” day. For instance, if your message is sent during a regular school day (weekday/non-holiday), I will do my best to get back to you by the next regular school day. Due to my parenting duties, I check my email infrequently in the evenings and weekends. If you email me the night before an assignment is due, I am unlikely to be able to respond in time.\nAdditional Policies # Classroom Behavior # Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. For more information, see the classroom behavior policy and the Student Code of Conduct.\nRequirements for COVID-19 # As a matter of public health and safety, all members of the CU Boulder community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department and building requirements and all public health orders in place to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. CU Boulder currently requires COVID-19 vaccination and boosters for all faculty, staff and students. Students, faculty and staff must upload proof of vaccination and boosters or file for an exemption based on medical, ethical or moral grounds through the MyCUHealth portal.\nThe CU Boulder campus is currently mask-optional. However, if public health conditions change and masks are again required in classrooms, students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution. For more information, see the policy on classroom behavior and the Student Code of Conduct. If you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from fulfilling these safety measures, please follow the steps in the “Accommodation for Disabilities” statement on this syllabus.\nIf you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19, if you have tested positive for COVID-19, or if you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should stay home and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (contacttracing@colorado.edu). If you are fully vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay home; rather, you should self-monitor for symptoms and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (contacttracing@colorado.edu). As in the case of any illness, please notify your instructor if you will not be attending class with an estimation of how long you may be gone to request extensions to upcoming deadlines. Not all deadlines will be able to be extended, and in this case, we will determine an alterative plan for the assignment submissions.\nAccommodation for Disabilities # If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment. Information on requesting accommodations is located on the Disability Services website. Contact Disability Services website at 303-492-8671 or dsinfo@colorado.edu for further assistance. If you have a temporary medical condition, see Temporary Medical Conditions on the Disability Services website.\nPreferred Student Names and Pronouns # CU Boulder recognizes that students\u0026rsquo; legal information doesn\u0026rsquo;t always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors\u0026rsquo; class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student\u0026rsquo;s legal name.\nHonor Code # All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code (honor@colorado.edu); 303-492-5550). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found at the Honor Code Office website.\nSexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation # The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to fostering a positive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct intimate partner abuse (including dating or domestic violence), stalking, protected-class discrimination or harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or cureport@colorado.edu.

When the breakout groups close, everyone will join the main lecture and the facilitators will share common themes, inspirations, and ideas that emerged from their conversation.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/courses/experimental-textiles/docs/templates/weeklies-template/","title":"Weeklies Template","section":"Templates","content":" Weeklies Template # Each weekly will give you a prompt and a technique to use. In your assignment turn turn in, you\u0026rsquo;ll will describe what you did. This template is about process. Process means the journey you follow when attempting an assignment, not just the ending point. All the things that you do that go well, inspire a next step, or go not as you planed and either cause you to change your direction. All these experiences are equally valuable as long as we document and share them with each other. To borrow, again, from Corita Kent\u0026rsquo;s rules for an art studio, \u0026ldquo;the only rule is work\u0026rdquo;. With that in mind, we want you to submit the following for each of your weeklies:\nTemplate # Weekly Name\nYour Name\nWhat are you Setting Out to Do? # Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you\u0026rsquo;ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that\u0026rsquo;s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.\nProcess Notes # Its critical to make observations and take time while you are exploring materials and techniques. We want to submit a collection (at least three, but more are welcome) of your notes on process. Each note should include a photo and an observation or idea that emerged.\nReflection: # A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you\u0026rsquo;d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you\u0026rsquo;d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process.\nGrading Rubric # Rather than marking down, we\u0026rsquo;ll calculate grades by adding up what the assignment did well. We expect each student to spend at least 3 hours on each weekly. The scores on each weekly will range from 0-10.\nItem Max Point Value Execution: All parts of the template were turned in and showed a good faith effort in their process and findings. +3 Quality: Documentation is of high quality and provide evidence to support the findings. +3 Writing: The written descriptions are clear and effectively describe the value of the findings gleaned +2 Engagement: The assignment demonstrates engagement in the course and its materials and/or external resources. All references to course materials and outside references are cited and/or linked +2 Example Weekly (Blog Format) # Laura Devendorf\nSample Weekly\nVision: I got these new yarns, paper and fern silk and things, and I am wondering what to make with them. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking something to do with sound and texture. Since I had some left over warp on the loom, I stared by just playing with the paper yarns and seeing how they pack and shape and then choosing my next step from there.\nProcess Note 1: The paper seems to pack and expand to whatever space its given. Specifically, in a tight weave it packs down. I chose to weave it with a basket weave structure just to give it a little more room. I then expanded out to larger basket weaves to see how it might \u0026ldquo;bloom\u0026rdquo; and then also doubled up the passes to make the rows a bit thicker. Between each row I threw thin tensel to keep the overall structure in tact. I began to enjoy the feel of the tests as a kind of tapestry, and decided that I should not just sample, but try to make something with an interesting aesthetic.\nProcess Note 2: With the idea that I should make it a more official piece, I decided to bind the bottom edge of the textile while its on the loom. I have applied a similar technique after weaving, but during weaving seemed to be a bit easier and I wanted to see how it might work. It took me a while to figure out the process, but then I found a technique that worked: see below:\nProcess Note 3: Taking a step back and reflecting, I began to see the loopy ends of the paper being the most interesting. In the next steps, I played with this more:\nAt first, I though I would create patterns by interlacing the loops and allowing them to travel in different directions.\nI then realized that the contrast between the looping paper and the brown warps created the most visual interest and I wanted to emphasize that by having more open regions of the brown.\nReflection: The ideas I explored didn\u0026rsquo;t lead to any magical insights, but I did find that the paper might work best when integrated into tapestry, as a kind of texture. I also enjoyed the sound of working with the paper, making me want to explore how it could be designed to produce sounds more intentionally, like associated with particular movements. Maybe an integrated speaker might further amplify the sound.\n"}]
