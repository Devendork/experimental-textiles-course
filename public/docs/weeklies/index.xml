      <description>1. Documentation Exploration # Documentation is a critical part of this course and it is done best when you have a dedicated setup or space for documenting while you work. This week, consider where you will be working on projects for this class and explore several options for capturing and documentation (e.g. photography, video).
Your goal is to find the setup that offers you the most quality for least effort.</description>

      <description>2. Make a Loom # Watch this video: Repeat the process to make a loom with the following specifications. Your loom should have at least 20 ends/warps and use at least 2 colors. Weave two colors in any combination in the weft. Integrate at least 12&amp;quot; of conductive yarn or thread into the weave by any means you imagine. Weave something that relates to the contents of the book. Ask yourself, what else could you make a loom out of?</description>

      <description>3. Warp and Weave # If you missed the in class warping, watch this video: Work with your partner to warp your cricket loom with 1 - 2 yards of cloth, 4-5 inches wide at 8 ends per inch.
While you are working on a shared loom, each student should weave 3, 3-4‚Äù sections that experiment with a different technique and weave 2 inches of a tabby between each section.</description>

      <description>4. Dynamic Wefts # This week we will be rewarping and adding &amp;ldquo;frames&amp;rdquo; to our looms. Wind 2 yards of warp using a warping board or improvised method and then attach it to your loom. You should wind 40-50 warps using the 3/2 pearl cotton yarn provided in class. Use string heddles to create four frames in a straight draw.
Next, collect some materials to weave with that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t typically consider to be &amp;ldquo;yarn&amp;rdquo;.</description>
