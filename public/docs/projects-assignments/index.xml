      <description>Midterm Project: Follow the Materials # Your midterm project is to produce a series of swatches that explore a particular goal according to heuristics you define. This is a chance for you to explore one technique or material more deeply, and to present it to the class.
The Assignment Description:
Your swatch should emerge from a challenge that you define. Perhaps that challenge is figuring out how to best integrate a given material, a new approach to drafting, or the desire to achieve a specific function.</description>

      <description>Final Project: Keep Following the Materials # Your final project is to extend what you learned in your midterm by making a swatch for a class swatch book that demonstrates some functionality, possibly something that you discovered. We take inspiration in this assignment from the e-textiles swatch exchange, where practitioners develop small samples of a material outcome of a technique they developed and instructions for replication that are shared into a physical book with other practitioners.</description>
