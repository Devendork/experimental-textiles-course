<p>All students will be given access to a materials kit that they can use for their projects this semester. Depending on where each interest and process progresses, the Instructors may be able to lend you additional equipment and resources.</p>
<p>Documentation will be a critical part of the class, so you may want to invest in a tri-pod or stationary mount for your smart phone or other camera, a macro lens (for your phone or other camera), and a quality set of lighting for photography. If you are having trouble obtaining these items, let the instructors know and we can help you.</p>

<p>This course has been developed as part of a larger grant studying smart textiles collaboration. In week two, the instructor or one of her students will describe how research will take place in the class and give you the opportunity to opt into or out of those research activities. Your participation in the research activities will have no effects on your grade.</p>

Please send all email inquiries to <a href="mailto:laura.devendorf@colorado.edu">laura.devendorf@colorado.edu</a>. Please also put “[<strong>SO</strong>]” in the subject line so that I can easily recognize and respond to your email. I will do my best to respond to emails within one “business” day. For instance, if your message is sent during a regular school day (weekday/non-holiday), I will do my best to get back to you by the next regular school day. Due to my parenting duties, I check my email infrequently in the evenings and weekends. If you email me the night before an assignment is due, I am unlikely to be able to respond in time.</p>

  Classroom Behavior
  <a class="anchor" href="#classroom-behavior">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy.  For more information, see the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">classroom behavior policy</a> and the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/">Student Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<h3 id="requirements-for-covid-19">
  Requirements for COVID-19
  <a class="anchor" href="#requirements-for-covid-19">#</a>
</h3>
<p>As a matter of public health and safety, all members of the CU Boulder community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department and building requirements and all public health orders in place to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. CU Boulder currently requires COVID-19 vaccination and boosters for all faculty, staff and students. Students, faculty and staff must upload proof of vaccination and boosters or file for an exemption based on medical, ethical or moral grounds through the MyCUHealth portal.</p>
<p>The CU Boulder campus is currently mask-optional. However, if public health conditions change and masks are again required in classrooms, students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution. For more information, see the policy on classroom behavior and the Student Code of Conduct. If you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from fulfilling these safety measures, please follow the steps in the “Accommodation for Disabilities” statement on this syllabus.</p>
<p>If you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19, if you have tested positive for COVID-19, or if you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should stay home and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu">contacttracing@colorado.edu</a>). If you are fully vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay home; rather, you should self-monitor for symptoms and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu">contacttracing@colorado.edu</a>). As in the case of any illness, please notify your instructor if you will not be attending class with an estimation of how long you may be gone to request extensions to upcoming deadlines. Not all deadlines will be able to be extended, and in this case, we will determine an alterative plan for the assignment submissions.</p>
<h3 id="accommodation-for-disabilities">
  Accommodation for Disabilities
  <a class="anchor" href="#accommodation-for-disabilities">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the Disability Services website. Contact <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students">Disability Services website</a> at 303-492-8671 or <a href="mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu">dsinfo@colorado.edu</a>  for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition, see <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions">Temporary Medical Conditions</a> on the Disability Services website.</p>
<h3 id="preferred-student-names-and-pronouns">
  Preferred Student Names and Pronouns
  <a class="anchor" href="#preferred-student-names-and-pronouns">#</a>
</h3>
<p>CU Boulder recognizes that students&rsquo; legal information doesn&rsquo;t always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors&rsquo; class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student&rsquo;s legal name.</p>
<h3 id="honor-code">
  Honor Code
  <a class="anchor" href="#honor-code">#</a>
</h3>
<p>All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code (honor@colorado.edu); 303-492-5550). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code">Honor Code Office website</a>.</p>

  Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation
  <a class="anchor" href="#sexual-misconduct-discrimination-harassment-andor-related-retaliation">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to fostering a positive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct intimate partner abuse (including dating or domestic violence), stalking, protected-class discrimination or harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or <a href="mailto:cureport@colorado.edu">cureport@colorado.edu</a>. Information about the OIEC, university policies, <a href="https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PnqVK4kkIJIZnf">anonymous reporting</a>, and the campus resources can be found on the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/">OIEC website</a>.</p>
<p>Please know that faculty and instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when made aware of incidents of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals impacted receive information about options for reporting and support resources.</p>
<h3 id="religious-holidays">
  Religious Holidays
  <a class="anchor" href="#religious-holidays">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance.  Please contact me via email or office hours by the end of the second week of the course with specific dates that present conflicts so that I have an opportunity to make systemic adjustments to the course requirements that will benefit all students. See the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams">campus policy regarding religious observances</a> for full details.</p>
