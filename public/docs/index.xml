      <description>Material List # While most equipment required for the class will be provided, we are asking students to purchase a few materials on their own, as they are ones we expect some might already own. After the first half of the class, each student will refine their direction and may need access to more specific equipment and supplies. In that case, we have created a &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; for you to check out or take materials as they are required.</description>
