      <description>1. Documentation Exploration # Documentation is a critical part of this course and it is done best when you have a dedicated setup or space for documenting while you work. This week, consider where you will be working on projects for this class and explore several options for capturing and documentation (e.g. photography, video).
Your goal is to find the setup that offers you the most quality for least effort.</description>

      <title>Midterm Project</title>

      <description>Midterm Project: Follow the Materials # Your midterm project is to produce a series of swatches that explore a particular goal according to heuristics you define. This is a chance for you to explore one technique or material more deeply, and to present it to the class.
The Assignment Description:
Your swatch should emerge from a challenge that you define. Perhaps that challenge is figuring out how to best integrate a given material, a new approach to drafting, or the desire to achieve a specific function.</description>

      <title>2 - Make A Loom</title>

      <description>2. Make a Loom # Watch this video: Repeat the process to make a loom with the following specifications. Your loom should have at least 20 ends/warps and use at least 2 colors. Weave two colors in any combination in the weft. Integrate at least 12&amp;quot; of conductive yarn or thread into the weave by any means you imagine. Weave something that relates to the contents of the book. Ask yourself, what else could you make a loom out of?</description>

      <description>Final Project: Keep Following the Materials # Your final project is to extend what you learned in your midterm by making a swatch for a class swatch book that demonstrates some functionality, possibly something that you discovered. We take inspiration in this assignment from the e-textiles swatch exchange, where practitioners develop small samples of a material outcome of a technique they developed and instructions for replication that are shared into a physical book with other practitioners.</description>

      <description>3. Warp and Weave # If you missed the in class warping, watch this video: Work with your partner to warp your cricket loom with 1 - 2 yards of cloth, 4-5 inches wide at 8 ends per inch.
While you are working on a shared loom, each student should weave 3, 3-4‚Äù sections that experiment with a different technique and weave 2 inches of a tabby between each section.</description>

      <description>Material List # While most equipment required for the class will be provided, we are asking students to purchase a few materials on their own, as they are ones we expect some might already own. After the first half of the class, each student will refine their direction and may need access to more specific equipment and supplies. In that case, we have created a &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; for you to check out or take materials as they are required.</description>

      <guid>http://unstable.design/courses/experimental-textiles/docs/weeklies/4-dynamic-wefts/</guid>
      <description>4. Dynamic Wefts # This week we will be rewarping and adding &amp;ldquo;frames&amp;rdquo; to our looms. Wind 2 yards of warp using a warping board or improvised method and then attach it to your loom. You should wind 40-50 warps using the 3/2 pearl cotton yarn provided in class. Use string heddles to create four frames in a straight draw.
Next, collect some materials to weave with that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t typically consider to be &amp;ldquo;yarn&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>5. Embodying Weave Structure # This weekly is a 2-week weekly that will consist of several parts. Complete the following:
Complete the reverse drafting worksheet with a swatch that will be provided to you in class. Follow each step on the worksheet carefully and make notes and comments about what you learned through this process in your weekly write up. Please bring your physical worksheet to class on Oct 10 for grading as part of this weekly.</description>

      <description>9. Designing for Jacquard # Use AdaCAD to design a bitmap to &amp;ldquo;produce&amp;rdquo; using the Jacquard loom. The file must be 2360 pixels wide and no more than 100 pics. You are welcome to produce a sample blanket, image motif, or cloth.</description>

      <description>In Class Critique Structure # Each week, we will critique each other&amp;rsquo;s weeklies in a method that resembles Liz Lerman&amp;rsquo;s Critical Response Process. This process is used to help us guide a critique while still keeping the maker&amp;rsquo;s ideas, goals, and values central to the evaluation of the work.
First, we will quickly share our projects to the whole class, next, we will break into breakout groups of roughly 4 students each.</description>

      <description>Weeklies Template # Each weekly will give you a prompt and a technique to use. In your assignment turn turn in, you&amp;rsquo;ll will describe what you did. This template is about process. Process means the journey you follow when attempting an assignment, not just the ending point. All the things that you do that go well, inspire a next step, or go not as you planed and either cause you to change your direction.</description>
